# Etsy Christmas List
## An Iron Yard Assignment

### Goal
Create an app using **Angular 1** that integrates any API of your choice - I used Etsy.

### Description
Etsy items can be searched for on the home screen, then added to either a "Wishlist" of item you want for yourself, or a "Giftlist" of items you plan to give others. You also have the option of viewing "more details" about each item. Please note that you may need to refresh in order to view changes to the wishlist or giftlist.

### Deploy Locally
1. Clone repo
2. <code>bower install</code>
3. <code>serve</code>
4. Open localhost:3000
